    <p>At <a href="https://booking.com">Booking.com</a>, we use MySQL replication extensively
for read scaling.  However, because we have so many slaves
(we have thousands), sooner or later, one of them
will fail.  In MySQL 5.5 and earlier, replication was not
crash-safe.  MySQL 5.6 provides crash-safe replication when
modifying the default configuration. But this safety comes with
several downsides.  Read on to find out more about crash-safe replication
in MySQL 5.6 and learn how to mitigate its downsides.</p>
<p>MySQL replication involves two tasks on a slave: the IO thread and
the SQL thread:</p>
<ul>
<li>The IO thread downloads events from the master binary logs
  and appends them to the relay logs.</li>
<li>The SQL thread reads the events from the relay logs and executes
  them on the local database.</li>
</ul>
<p>To keep track of its progress, each thread needs to store a state:</p>
<ul>
<li>The IO thread keeps track of the next event to download from
  the master binary logs using two variables: a filename and a position
  (Master_Log_File and Read_Master_Log_Pos from <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/show-slave-status.html">SHOW SLAVE
  STATUS</a>).</li>
<li>The SQL thread keeps track of the next event to execute using four
  variables: the filename and position in the slave relay logs
  and the two corresponding values in the master binary logs
  (respectively Relay_Log_File, Relay_Log_Pos, Relay_Master_Log_File
  and Exec_Master_Log_Pos from SHOW SLAVE STATUS).</li>
</ul>
<p>In MySQL 5.5 and earlier, those states are persisted in files
(see the <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/replication-options-slave.html#option_mysqld_master-info-file">master-info-file</a>
and <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/replication-options-slave.html#option_mysqld_relay-log-info-file">relay-log-info-file</a>
options for more information about those files).  However, the IO thread
and the SQL thread cannot make progress and update their state files at the
same time (atomically).  This means that inconsistencies can be
introduced by a crash:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the IO thread has appended data to the relay logs but has
   not updated its state file when MySQL crashes, <strong>the same event
   is re-appended</strong> to the relay logs after restart.</li>
<li>If the SQL thread has committed a transaction but has not
   updated its state file when MySQL crashes, <strong>the same transaction
   is re-run</strong> after restart.</li>
</ol>
<p>Those two inconsistencies are the cause of the infamous "Duplicate
entry for key PRIMARY" errors when restarting a slave after a crash.
This error happens when running an INSERT twice.  Other errors can
also happen on UPDATE and DELETE statements depending on many factors,
the list of which is too long and complex to give here.  In the worst cases
silent data corruption will occur.</p>
<p>To solve inconsistency #2 above, MySQL 5.6 introduces the option
to persist the state of the SQL thread in the database.  By setting
<a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/replication-options-slave.html#option_mysqld_relay-log-info-repository">relay-log-info-repository</a>
to TABLE (this is not the default option), the SQL thread saves
its state at the same time as it commits a transaction.  If the
storage engine is atomic (like InnoDB), inconsistency in the
state of the SQL thread is prevented.</p>
<p>However, it is not possible to avoid inconsistency #1.
The IO thread has no way to synchronize its
progress (appending events to the relay logs) and its
state (saving data in a FILE or a TABLE).  The consequence
is that it is impossible, once a crash has occurred, to trust both the content of the relay
log and the state of the IO thread.</p>
<p>If we cannot trust those, how can MySQL 5.6 provide crash-safe
replication?  The implemented solution is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initialize the state of the IO thread to the position of
  the SQL thread (which can be trusted when relay-log-info-repository
  is set to TABLE and the storage engine is atomic), and</li>
<li>Advance the position of the SQL thread to the tail
  of the relay logs.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, all the relay logs are considered <em>un-proper for
SQL thread consumption</em>.  This behaviour is not enabled by
default.  To benefit from it, the option
<a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/replication-options-slave.html#option_mysqld_relay-log-recovery">relay-log-recovery</a>
must be set to 1 (the default value is 0).</p>
<p>In summary, to obtain crash-safe replication in MySQL 5.6, one
must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set relay-log-info-repository to TABLE,</li>
<li>Set relay-log-recovery to 1, and</li>
<li>Use only atomic storage engines.</li>
</ul>
<p>More information about <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/slave-logs.html#replication-implementation-crash-safe">MySQL 5.6 crash-safe
replication</a>
can be found in the manual.</p>
<h2>The problems with MySQL 5.6 Crash-safe replication</h2>
<p>So far, everything looks good, so what are the downsides?  We
identified a number of problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>When setting relay-log-recovery to 1 in the configuration file,
   the relay logs are considered un-proper for SQL thread consumption
   every time MySQL is started.</li>
<li>After a restart or a crash, if the
   IO thread had been ahead of the SQL thread, unnecessary traffic caused by
   downloading binary logs will be incurred on both the master and on the network.</li>
<li>After a restart or a crash,
   if the master is not available, no progress
   can be made by the SQL thread, even if there are plenty of
   unexecuted relay logs on the slave.</li>
<li>After a restart or a crash, if critical binary logs
   have been purged from the master, the slave will not be able to
   resume replication.</li>
<li>If we want to keep a copy of the relay logs on the
   slave by setting
   <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/replication-options-slave.html#option_mysqld_relay-log-purge">relay-log-purge</a>
   to 0, a restart or a crash could corrupt the stored relay logs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Problem #1 means that all restarts must be done with extra care.
If a lagging slave is restarted, it can trigger problems #2, #3, #4, and #5.
Having those problems after a crash could be acceptable, but
having those after a simple restart is harder to accept.</p>
<p>Problem #2 is the one that worries us most at Booking.com.
As presented in a <a href="https://blog.booking.com/mysql_slave_scaling_and_more.html">previous
post</a>,
the network load on our master is a concern for us.  The idea
of a master network interface being overloaded as a result of a restart/crash of a slave
is hard to accept.</p>
<p>A special case of problem #2 is <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/replication-delayed.html">delayed
replication</a>.
In the case of a restart/crash of a delayed slave the amount of the binary log that needs to be re-downloaded is proportional to the delay of the slave.
We have delayed slaves that store tens
of GBs of unexecuted relay logs.  A restart/crash of those would overload
the network interface or a master for minutes.  This is unbearable:
we must find something better.</p>
<p>Again on problem #2, the restarted/crashed slave could be remote from the
master.  If the bandwidth of the WAN link is limited, it can be saturated
by the slave downloading binary logs from the master.  This is also an
undesirable effect.</p>
<p>Problem #3 is less of a concern for us, but still not an
enjoyable proposition (it might be more of a concern for others).</p>
<p>Problem #4 means that before purging binary logs, a DBA must make
sure that they have been <strong>executed</strong> by all slaves.  This is an
additional task that DBAs could do without.</p>
<p>Problem #5 is more subtle since it is dependent upon the preference of our DBAs
to keep a copy of the relay logs on the slave (setting relay-log-purge
to 0).  With relay-log-recovery=1, this copy of the relay logs
cannot be trusted after a restart or a crash:</p>
<ul>
<li>If before a restart or a crash there are unexecuted events in the
  relay logs, which are appended again to the relay logs after a
  restart, resulting in duplicate events in the relay logs (not executed
  in double though).</li>
<li>If just before an operating system crash some events are executed by the
  SQL thread but not synced to the relay logs by the IO thread, those
  events are missing from the relay logs after the restart.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following bugs/feature requests have been logged to trace those problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=74089">Bug # 74089</a>: Report
  Relay_Log_File and Relay_Log_Pos on relay-log-recovery.</li>
<li><a href="https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=74321">Bug # 74321</a>: Execute
  relay-log-recovery only when needed.</li>
<li><a href="https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=74323">Bug # 74323</a>: Avoid overloading
  the master NIC on crash recovery of a lagging slave.</li>
<li><a href="https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=74324">Bug # 74324</a>: Make keeping
  relay logs (relay_log_purge=0) crash safe.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our wishes for MySQL Crash-safe replication</h2>
<p>Do not get us wrong. Having a way to make replication crash-safe
is a great step forward since MySQL 5.5.  Still, some other small steps
need to be carried out to have ideal crash-safe replication.  For
us, ideal crash-safe replication should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not take destructive measures if no crash has happened</li>
<li>Minimize the number of binary logs downloaded from the master
   on crash recovery</li>
<li>Have consistent relay logs after crash recovery when relay_log_purge=0.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our wish #2 above can be implemented by adding four variables to
the IO thread state.  Those variables would indicate the last
trusted (synced) position in the relay logs and the
corresponding position in the master binary logs.
When restarting MySQL, the relay
logs would be truncated at that last synced position and the IO
thread would be initialized at the corresponding position in the
master binary logs. (Note that if the IO thread was stopped
correctly, nothing is truncated, which satisfies our wish #1
above.)
After the truncation, if the position of the SQL thread
is above (or at) the truncation point (IO thread ahead of or at the
same position as the SQL thread), nothing special needs to be
done.
If the position of the SQL thread is after the truncation point,
the behaviour will depend on relay_log_purge:</p>
<ul>
<li>If relay_log_purge is 1, all the previous relay logs are
  dropped and the IO thread position is set to the SQL position.</li>
<li>If relay_log_purge is 0, more work must be done to honour the
  DBA's wish to keep the relay logs.  To do that, the IO thread
  must be started UNTIL the position of the SQL thread.  When the
  IO thread reaches this position, the SQL thread can be started
  after updating its corresponding relay log position.  This
  satisfies our wish #3 above.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our workaround</h2>
<p>Until ideal crash-safe replication is implemented in a future version of
MySQL, we need to mitigate the problems caused by the current
implementation (for our deployment at Booking.com, the biggest problem
is unnecessarily downloading binary logs from the
master).  The solution we are currently investigating is to deploy a
<a href="https://mariadb.com/blog/mariadb-replication-maxscale-and-need-binlog-server/">Binlog
Server</a>
on our slaves:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Binlog Server downloads binary logs from the master</li>
<li>The slave downloads the binary logs from the local
  Binlog Server</li>
<li>If the slave is restarted (after a crash or a
  planned restart), it will not put undesired load on the master
  because the binary logs will be downloaded locally</li>
</ul>
<p>This way, we avoid the downsides of MySQL relay log recovery
by pushing the problem to the Binlog Server.  And because making the
Binlog Server crash-safe is trivial, we successfully work-around the
downsides of MySQL relay log recovery.</p>
<p>But if we are not careful with this approach, we could end up
consuming twice the disk space that is necessary by storing binary logs in the
Binlog Server directory, and storing the relay logs in the MySQL directory.</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/replication-options-slave.html#option_mysqld_relay-log-space-limit">relay-log-space-limit</a>
option can be used to solve this problem.
By setting this option to twice the max-relay-log-size (as
recommended in the documentation), we put an upper limit on the
extra space that can be used.  But when using this option, care must be taken
to set it right as changing the value will necessitate restarting
MySQL <a href="#fn1">[1]</a>.  There is a feature request (bug #68236) to <a href="https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=68236">make the
relay-log-space-limit option
dynamic</a>.
Hopefully this will be implemented soon.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As promised in <a href="https://blog.booking.com/mysql_slave_scaling_and_more.html">our last
post</a>,
we presented another case for using the Binlog Server.  Hopefully,
this will be a temporary use that will become obsolete. When a better relay log
recovery is implemented in MySQL, we will not need to
deploy additional software on our MySQL servers.</p>
<p>We have yet another instance where using the Binlog Server is beneficial.
I will present this at <a href="https://www.percona.com/live/london-2014/">Percona Live
London</a> in my talk:
<a href="https://www.percona.com/live/london-2014/sessions/high-availability-disaster-recovery-and-extreme-read-scaling-using-binlog-servers">High Availability, Disaster Recovery and Extreme Read
Scaling using Binlog
Servers</a>.</p>
<p><a name="fn1">[1]</a>:
When restarting MySQL to change the option, care must be
taken not to restart MySQL with relay-log-recovery=1 as this could cause the
unnecessary re-downloading of binary logs. With a local Binlog Server, this
becomes less of a concern.</p>
