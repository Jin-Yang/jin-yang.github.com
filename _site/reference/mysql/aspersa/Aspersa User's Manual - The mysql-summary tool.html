		<div class="content">

The <em>mysql-summary</em> tool is a convenient way to summarize the 
status and configuration of a MySQL database server, so that you can 
learn about it at a glance.  It is not a tuning tool or diagnosis tool; 
expert humans are better at that.  It produces a report that is easy to 
'diff,' and can be pasted into emails without losing the formatting.  It
 should work well on Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris, and perhaps others as 
well; please report any bugs you find on decently capable Unix-like 
systems.  It will not work on Windows.<p></p>

<h2>Command-Line Options and Environment Variables</h2>

<p>This tool does not use any environment variables.  Any command-line 
options are simply passed through to the MySQL client tools when 
querying the database server.</p>

<h2>How it Works</h2>

<p>This tool works by connecting to a MySQL database server and querying
 it for status and configuration information.  It saves these bits of 
data into files in /tmp, and then formats them neatly with <em>awk</em> and other scripting languages.</p>

<p>The tool interacts minimally with the server upon which it runs.  It 
assumes that you'll run it on the same server you're inspecting, and 
therefore it assumes that it will be able to find the <em>my.cnf</em> 
configuration file, for example.  However, it should degrade gracefully 
if this is not the case.  Note, however, that its output does not 
indicate which information comes from the MySQL database and which comes
 from the host operating system, so it is possible for confusing output 
to be generated if you run the tool on one server and direct it to 
connect to a MySQL database server running on another server.</p>

<h2 id="fuzzy">Fuzzy-Rounding</h2>

<p>Many of the outputs from this tool are deliberately rounded to show 
their magnitude but not the exact detail.  This is called 
fuzzy-rounding.  The idea is that it doesn't matter whether a server is 
running 918 queries per second or 921 queries per second; such a small 
variation is insignificant, and only makes the output hard to compare to
 other servers.  Fuzzy-rounding rounds in larger increments as the input
 grows.  It begins by rounding to the nearest 5, then the nearest 10, 
nearest 25, and then repeats by a factor of 10 larger (50, 100, 250), 
and so on, as the input grows.</p>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>

<p>Simply execute the tool, passing any connection options that you wish
 to use for the underlying MySQL client tools.  If you run the tool 
interactively, then it will prompt you to decide whether to dump and 
analyze the server's schema structures; if run non-interactively, it 
will assume No and skip the schema analysis step.</p>

<p>The following is an example report.  Each section is followed by a discussion of its contents and meaning.</p>

<code>
# Aspersa MySQL Summary Report ###############################
         System time | 2010-09-22 15:33:38 UTC (local TZ: PDT -0700)
</code>

<p>The first section simply shows the time the report was generated, in 
UTC time.  This comes from the operating system where the tool is 
executed, not from the MySQL server.</p>

<code>
# Instances ##################################################
  Port  Data Directory             Socket
  ===== ========================== ======
   3306 /var/lib/mysql/data        /tmp/mysql.sock
</code>

<p>The <u>Instances</u> report is generated from the output of <em>ps</em>
 and shows one line per server instance.  Sometimes it is not able to 
detect some of the parameters such as the port number.  From this point 
on, the report will be about a single MySQL server instance; if multiple
 instances are running, you might need to run multiple reports.</p>

<code>

</code>

<p>This section is a quick summary of the MySQL instance: version, uptime, and other very basic parameters.  The <u>Time</u>
 output is generated from the MySQL server, unlike the system date and 
time printed earlier, so you can see whether the database and operating 
system's time matches.</p>

<p>This section is a summary of the output from SHOW PROCESSLIST.  Each 
sub-section is aggregated by a different item, which is shown as the 
first column heading.  When summarized by Command, every row in SHOW 
PROCESSLIST is included, but otherwise, rows whose Command is Sleep are 
excluded  from the SUM and MAX columns, so they don't skew the numbers 
too much.</p>

<p>The columns are the number of rows included, the number that are not 
in Sleep status, the sum of the Time column, and the maximum Time 
column.  The numbers are <a href="#fuzzy">fuzzy-rounded</a>.</p>

</code>

<p>This section shows selected counters from two snapshots of SHOW GLOBAL STATUS, gathered approximately 10 seconds apart and <a href="#fuzzy">fuzzy-rounded</a>.
  It includes only items that are incrementing counters; it does not 
include absolute numbers such as the Threads_running status variable, 
which represents a current value, rather than an accumulated number over
 time.</p>

<p>The first column is the variable name, and the second column is the 
counter from the first snapshot divided by 86400, so you can see the 
magnitude of the counter's change per day.  86400 fuzzy-rounds to 90000,
 so the Uptime counter should always be about 90000.</p>

<p>The third column is the value from the first snapshot, divided by 
Uptime and then fuzzy-rounded, so it represents approximately how 
quickly the counter is growing per-second over the uptime of the server.</p>

<p>The third column is the incremental difference from the first and 
second snapshot, divided by the difference in uptime and then 
fuzzy-rounded.  Therefore, it shows how quickly the counter is growing 
per second at the time the report was generated.</p>

<p>If you select to dump the schema and analyze it, the tool will print 
the above section.  This summarizes the number and type of objects in 
the database.  It is generated by running <em>mysqldump --no-data</em>, not by querying the INFORMATION_SCHEMA, which can freeze a busy server.</p>

<p>You can choose not to dump the schema, to dump all of the databases, 
or to dump only a single named one, by specifying the appropriate 
options.  In the example above, we are dumping all databases.  If only a
 single one is dumped, its name will appear as {chosen}.</p>

<p>The first sub-report in the section is the count of objects by type 
in each database: tables, views, and so on.  The second one shows how 
many tables use various storage engines in each database.  The third 
sub-report shows the number of each type of indexes in each database.</p>

<p>The last section shows the number of columns of various data types in
 each database.  For compact display, the column headers are formatted 
vertically, so you need to read downwards from the top.  In this 
example, the first column is 'bigint' and the second column is 
'varchar'.</p>

<p>All of the numbers in this portion of the output are exact, not fuzzy-rounded.</p>

..................... (many lines omitted) ......................
</code>

<p>This section shows a pretty-printed version of the my.cnf file, with 
comments removed and with whitespace added to align things for easy 
reading.  The tool tries to detect the my.cnf file by looking at the 
output of <em>ps</em>, and if it does not find the location of the file there, it tries common locations until it finds a file.  <strong>Note:</strong>
 this file might not actually correspond with the server from which the 
report was generated.  This can happen when the tool isn't run on the 
same server it's reporting on, or when detecting the location of the 
configuration file fails.</p>
