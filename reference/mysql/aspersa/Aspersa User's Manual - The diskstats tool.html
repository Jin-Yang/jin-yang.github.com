	</div>

		<div class="content">

<p>The <em>diskstats</em> tool is related to <em>iostat</em>, but has some advantages.  It separates out reads and writes, for example, and computes some things that <em>iostat</em>
 does in either incorrect or confusing ways.  It is also menu-driven and
 interactive with several different ways to aggregate the data, and 
integrates well with <a href="http://aspersa.googlecode.com/svn/html/collect.html">the collect tool</a>.  These properties make it very convenient for quickly drilling down into I/O performance at the desired level of granularity.</p>

<h2>Command-Line Options and Environment Variables</h2>

<p>The tool has the following command-line options, which must come <em>first</em> on the command-line, before any filenames:</p>

<dl>
<dt>-c COLS</dt><dd>An     Awk regex of which columns to include.  Any columns whose names match the regex will be included in the output.</dd>
<dt>-d DEVICES</dt><dd>An  Awk regex of which devices to include.  Any devices (disks) whose names match the regex will be included in the output.</dd>
<dt>-g GROUPBY</dt><dd>The  group-by mode, which specifies how to aggregate the disk performance data.  The following options are permitted:
<dl>
      <dt>disk</dt><dd>Each line of output shows one disk device.</dd>
      <dt>sample</dt><dd>Each line of output shows one sample of statistics.</dd>
      <dt>all</dt><dd>Each line of output shows one sample and one disk device.</dd>
</dl>
The default value is 'disk', which (unlike <em>iostat</em>) shows one 
line for each disk in the collected statistics; this makes it easy to 
begin by filtering out devices you do not want to examine.</dd>
<dt>-i INTERVAL</dt><dd>In sample mode, include INTERVAL seconds per 
sample.  The default is for every sample to result in one line of 
output.  If you set this to 60, for example, then each line will contain
 one minute's worth of input data.</dd>
<dt>-k KEEPFILE</dt><dd>A file to save diskstats samples in.  This is used when you specify no input file, in which case <em>diskstats</em>
 will capture and store samples of diskstats data; if you want to save 
them after the program exits, then specify a non-default filename here.</dd>
<dt>-n SAMPLES</dt><dd>  When in data-gathering mode (collecting samples live instead of reading an input file), stop collecting after N samples.</dd>
<dt>-s INTERVAL</dt><dd>When in data-gathering mode, both sample and redisplay /proc/diskstats every N seconds (default 1).</dd>
</dl>

<h2>How it Works</h2>

<p>This program works in two main modes.  One way is to process a file 
with saved disk statistics, which you specify on the command line.  The 
other way is to start a background process gathering samples at 
intervals and saving them into a file, and process this file in the 
foreground.  In both cases, the tool is interactively controlled by 
keystrokes, so you can redisplay and slice the data flexibly and easily.
  If the tool is not attached to a terminal, it doesn't run 
interactively; it just processes and prints its output, then exits.  
Otherwise it loops until you exit with the 'q' key.</p>

<p>The input is simple: the contents of /proc/diskstats, followed by timestamp lines in the format <em>TS <u>timestamp.nanoseconds</u> <u>ISO8601-timestamp</u></em>.  You can generate a sample file easily as follows:</p>

<code>
$ while sleep 1; do
   cat /proc/diskstats &gt;&gt; stats.txt
   date +'TS %s.%N %F %T' &gt;&gt; stats.txt
done
</code>

<p>This is exactly what the tool itself does to generate its own input. 
 This makes it easy to capture data even if you don't have the tool 
installed, transport it to another server, and analyze it there.</p>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>

<p>Let us start with a small sample file that is used for test cases.  
It is stored in the Subversion repository.  Start the tool as follows. 
Each subsequent code listing will show the output it generates.</p>

<code>

</code>

<p>The default display shown above has a line of column headers, 
followed by one line of output for every disk in the system.  These 
lines are aggregated from the first to the last sample of disk 
statistics in the file; in this example, you can see that the input file
 contains 4 samples of /proc/diskstats from the system where this data 
was collected.  The leftmost column specifies how many seconds' worth of
 samples were aggregated into each line.</p>

<p>The columns are as follows:</p>

<dl>
<dt>#ts</dt><dd>The number of seconds of samples in the line.  If there 
is only one, then the timestamp itself is shown, without the {curly 
braces}.</dd>
<dt>device</dt><dd>The device name.  If there is more than one device, 
then instead the number of devices aggregated into the line is shown, in
 {curly braces}.</dd>
<dt>rd_mb_s</dt><dd>The number of megabytes read per second, average, during the sampled interval.</dd>
<dt>rd_cnc</dt><dd>The average concurrency of the read operations, as 
computed by Little's Law (a.k.a. queueing theory).  In the example 
above, you can see that cciss/c0d1 had on average 1.4 reads in progress 
at all times during the sampled interval.</dd>
<dt>rd_rt</dt><dd>The average response time of the read operations, in milliseconds.</dd>
<dt>wr_mb_s</dt><dd>Megabytes written per second, average.</dd>
<dt>wr_cnc</dt><dd>Write concurrency, similar to read concurrency.</dd>
<dt>wr_rt</dt><dd>Write response time, similar to read response time.</dd>
<dt>busy</dt><dd>The fraction of time that the device had at least one request in progress; this is what <em>iostat</em> calls %util (which is a misleading name).</dd>
<dt>in_prg</dt><dd>The number of requests that were in progress.  Unlike
 the read and write concurrencies, which are averages that are generated
 from reliable numbers, this number is an instantaneous sample, and you 
can see that it might represent a spike of requests, rather than the 
true long-term average.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In addition to the above columns, there are a few columns that are 
hidden by default.  If you press the 'c' key, and then press Enter, you 
will blank out the regular expression pattern that selects columns to 
display, and you will then see all columns:</p>

<code>
Enter a column pattern:

<p>The additional columns are as follows:</p>

<dl>
<dt>rd_s</dt><dd>The number of reads per second.</dd>
<dt>rd_avkb</dt><dd>The average size of the reads, in kilobytes.</dd>
<dt>rd_mrg</dt><dd>The percentage of read requests that were merged together in the disk scheduler before reaching the device.</dd>
<dt>wr_s, wr_avgkb, and wr_mrg</dt><dd>These are analogous to their rd_* cousins.</dd>
</dl>

<p>If you press the '?' key, you will bring up the interactive help menu that shows which keys control the program.</p>

<code>
   You can control this program by key presses:
   ------------------- Key ------------------- ---- Current Setting ----
   A, D, S) Set the group-by mode              disk
   c) Enter an awk regex to match column names cnc|rt|mb|busy|prg
   d) Enter an awk regex to match disk names   (none)
   i) Set the sample size in seconds           (none)
   s) Set the redisplay interval in seconds    1
   p) Pause the program
   q) Quit the program
   ------------------- Press any key to continue -----------------------
</code>

<p>If any of these isn't obvious, it should become obvious as we 
continue with the guided tour.  First, let's switch the display from 
disk-per-line to sample-per-line by pressing the 'S' key so that the 
group-by mode becomes <strong>S</strong>AMPLE.</p>

<code>
  #ts device       rd_mb_s rd_cnc   rd_rt wr_mb_s wr_cnc   wr_rt busy in_prg
  2.0 {8}             10.2    1.4    23.9    24.6    0.0     0.2  12%     18
  4.0 {8}              8.6    1.3    27.4    13.2    0.0     0.1  11%     17
  6.0 {8}              8.8    1.4    25.5    24.1    0.0     0.1  11%      9
  7.0 {8}             12.1    2.0    23.8    48.7    0.1     0.2  22%      5
</code>

<p>Now you can see the timestamp of each column, followed by the 
information that all 8 devices were grouped together for each line.  
Let's put this to use to actually find out what is happening on this 
server, in terms of I/O.  Switch back to <strong>D</strong>ISK aggregation mode, with the 'D' key:</p>

<code>
  #ts device       rd_mb_s rd_cnc   rd_rt wr_mb_s wr_cnc   wr_rt busy in_prg
  {4} ram0             0.0    0.0     0.0     0.0    0.0     0.0   0%      0
  {4} cciss/c0d0       0.0    0.0     0.0     0.5    0.0     0.6   0%      0
  {4} cciss/c0d0p1     0.0    0.0     0.0     0.0    0.0     0.0   0%      0
  {4} cciss/c0d0p2     0.0    0.0     0.0     0.5    0.0     0.6   0%      0
  {4} cciss/c0d1       9.6    1.4    25.1    23.3    0.0     0.1  13%     13
  {4} cciss/c1d0       0.0    0.0     0.0     0.0    0.0     0.0   0%      0
  {4} dm-0             0.0    0.0     0.0     0.4    0.0     0.7   0%      0
  {4} md0              0.0    0.0     0.0     0.0    0.0     0.0   0%      0
</code>

<p>It's obvious that <strong>cciss/c0d1 </strong> is the only disk this 
system is really using.  Let's filter on that disk so we can see it more
 clearly.  Press the 'd' key, and then type 'c0d1' to create a pattern 
that matches that device name:</p>

<code>
Enter a disk/device pattern: c0d1
  #ts device     rd_mb_s rd_cnc   rd_rt wr_mb_s wr_cnc   wr_rt busy in_prg
  {4} cciss/c0d1     9.6   11.5    25.1    23.3    0.1     0.1 102%     13
</code>

<p>Now, switch back to grouping by samples, with the 'S' key:</p>

<code>
  #ts device     rd_mb_s rd_cnc   rd_rt wr_mb_s wr_cnc   wr_rt busy in_prg
  2.0 cciss/c0d1    10.2   11.2    23.9    22.8    0.1     0.1  92%     18
  4.0 cciss/c0d1     8.6   10.2    27.4    12.6    0.1     0.1  91%     17
  6.0 cciss/c0d1     8.8   10.8    25.5    24.0    0.1     0.1  89%      9
  7.0 cciss/c0d1    12.1   16.2    23.8    44.1    0.2     0.1 172%      5
</code>

<p>It looks like this device's usage is fairly consistent from second to
 second — it is not spiking up and down.  But the device is quite busy, 
mostly with reads; there are more than ten reads at a time, on average, 
and the response time of those reads is very slow, compared to the 
writes.  In fact, this is a RAID controller with a battery-backed write 
cache, and the writes are simply going to the cache and returning, but 
of course the reads have to be serviced from the spindles, and that is 
rather slow.  (This device is still performing more slowly than it 
should.  It turned out on deeper diagnosis that something was wrong with
 the hardware.)</p>

<p>Now, what if we had a large sample, once per second, that was 
collected over tens of minutes?  That would scroll off the screen in 
sample mode.  To control this, we can set the size of the window that 
encloses a 'sample'.  Press the 'i' key, and set the sample size:</p>

<code>
Enter a sample size: 2
  #ts device     rd_mb_s rd_cnc   rd_rt wr_mb_s wr_cnc   wr_rt busy in_prg
  2.0 cciss/c0d1    18.8   21.4    25.5    35.5    0.2     0.1 183%     17
  6.0 cciss/c0d1     7.4    9.5    24.8    23.0    0.1     0.1  88%      5
</code>

<p>Here you can see that we have zoomed out.  If you have a large 
sample, for example many minutes, you can set the sampling interval to 
60 or 300 or something like that to fit everything onto one screen.</p>

<p>Press 'q' to quit the program, and let's start it up in its other 
mode, without a file.  I'll start it on my laptop.  Because I did not 
give it a saved file to analyze, it will start a process in the 
background to gather current disk activity and iteratively print it out,
 a sample at a time.  The main device on my laptop is /dev/sda2, so that
 is what I will start with to avoid seeing many lines of output per 
iteration:</p>

<code>
[baron@ginger aspersa]$ diskstats -d sda2
  #ts device rd_mb_s rd_cnc   rd_rt wr_mb_s wr_cnc   wr_rt busy in_prg
  {1} sda2       0.0    0.0     0.0     0.0    0.0     0.0   0%      0

</code>

<p>It is hard to show on this manual page, but each line above appears 
after a 1-second delay.  As you let the program run, the background 
process continues appending to the file, and the foreground process 
continues to analyze the last sample appended every second.  You can 
change the sampling and display interval with the 's' key.</p>

<code>
[baron@ginger aspersa]$ diskstats -d sda2

</code>

<p>Notice that after changing the redisplay interval, the headers are 
reprinted, followed by a summary of all the gathered statistics up to 
that point; after that, new lines appear once every 5 seconds.</p>
