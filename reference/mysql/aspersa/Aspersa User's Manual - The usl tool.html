<p>The <em>usl</em> tool helps you perform capacity planning by automating some of the process explained in <a href="http://www.perfdynamics.com/">Dr. Neil J. Gunther's</a> book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/3540261389?tag=xaprb-20">Guerrilla Capacity Planning</a> (presented in simplified form in <a href="http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2010/11/16/percona-white-paper-forecasting-mysql-scalability/">this Percona white paper</a>).  Given an input file with two columns, concurrency and throughput, this tool fits the data into Gunther's <em>Universal Scalability Law</em>.</p>

<p>This tool depends on <em>gnuplot</em> for plotting and curve-fitting.</p>

<h2>Command-Line Options and Environment Variables</h2>

<p>The tool has the following command-line options, which must come <em>first</em> on the command-line, before any filenames:</p>

<dl>
<dt>-a</dt><dd>Sets the label on the X-axis to 'node count' instead of 'concurrency,' which is the default.</dd>
<dt>-c CONVERSION</dt><dd>Specifies a conversion function to run the input data through before feeding it into the model.  See <a href="#conversions">Conversion Functions</a> for more details.</dd>
<dt>-e</dt><dd>Draws error lines on the final plot.</dd>
<dt>-i INTERVAL</dt><dd>When -c is given, specifies to aggregate the 
input data into intervals of -i seconds.  This can be useful for 
smoothing data.  See <a href="#conversions">Conversion Functions</a> for more details.</dd>
<dt>-k KEEPFILE</dt><dd>Specifies a file to hold the input data.  The 
specified file will not be removed when the program finishes, so you can
 re-analyze it if you wish.  This is handy when using -c to transform 
the data: you can run the transformation once, and then re-analyze the 
data many times.</dd>
<dt>-l LIMIT</dt><dd>Set the upper limit of the X axis in the final plot.</dd>
<dt>-L COLOR</dt><dd>The color for plotting points; when color is used, default is "lt rgb #80B000".</dd>
<dt>-m THREADS</dt><dd>When -c is given, enforces a maximum concurrency 
of THREADS in the input data.  Useful for filtering outliers such as 
instantaneous spikes of very high concurrency.</dd>
<dt>-n ADJUSTMENT</dt><dd>When -c is given, subtracts ADJUSTMENT from 
the concurrency.  Useful for compensating for tasks in the system that 
aren't really part of the workload you are measuring.</dd>
<dt>-o ONLY</dt><dd>Only produce plots specified in this comma-separated list.</dd>
<dt>-p PREFIX</dt><dd>A filename prefix for the generated images.</dd>
<dt>-P PORT</dt><dd>The port number for -c tcpdump.</dd>
<dt>-r</dt><dd>Render pdf and eps plots in color.</dd>
<dt>-R</dt><dd>Don't re-fit against the USL.  Use the kappa and gamma computed from quadratic regression, not USL regression.</dd>
<dt>-t FILETYPE</dt><dd>Type of images to generate.  The default is png, but you can also specify eps and pdf.</dd>
<dt>-T POINTTYPE</dt><dd>The gnuplot point type and options for the plots; default is 6.</dd>
<dt>-x ADJUSTMENT</dt><dd>Multiply the C(1) measurement by this factor.  Useful if the tool's interpolated value for C(1) is wrong.
</dd><dt>-X</dt><dd>Include C(1) as a fit parameter for USL regression.
</dd></dl>

<p>Any additional arguments on the command-line are treated as file names containing the input data to plot and model.</p>

<h2>How it Works</h2>

<p>The <em>usl</em> tool works by accepting some input data with columns
 of measurements.  Your input needs to have at least two columns: 
concurrency (N), and throughput (C).  See <a href="#conversions">Conversion Functions</a> if you need to convert from a different input before running the model.  
Lines beginning  with a # character are commented out.</p>

<p>The tool tries to find the C value for N=1.  If this exists directly 
in the input file, it will use that value.  If there are many 
measurements for N=1, it will use the average value.  If there is no N=1
 measurement, the tool will try to interpolate from the data it has, and
 you might need to adjust the result with -x.</p>

<p>After this step, the tool plots a number of graphs against the data. 
 To make sense of these graphs, you need to be familiar with Dr. 
Gunther's scalability model.  We will not document the meaning of the 
graphs in this user's manual.</p>

<p>Next, the tool transforms the input data, performs least-squares 
regression against it, and plots that.  The coefficients for the 
resulting fitted curve are 'a' and 'b', respectively.  The tool prints 
these out, along with the coefficient of determination to show how 
closely the line fits the points (the R-squared value).</p>

<p>The tool uses the 'a' and 'b' coefficients to approximate the 'sigma'
 and 'kappa' parameters to the Universal Scalability Law.  It then 
performs another least-squares regression against the Law, with the 
approximated parameters as starting points.  (It needs to generate 
reasonably good starting points, or <em>gnuplot</em> can have trouble 
with the regression; it can get stuck in a local maximum that is very 
wrong.)  After the second least-squares regression, the tool captures 
the 'sigma' and 'kappa' parameters, and plots the source data and the 
model.</p>

<h2 id="conversions">Conversion Functions</h2>

<p>The -c option specifies a pre-processing function to convert the 
input data into the necessary concurrency-vs-throughput format.  At 
present there is only one built-in converter.  In the future we might 
add more.

</p><p>If you want to save the converted output to inspect it, use -k.</p>

<dl>

<dt>globalstatus</dt>
<dd>
<p>This converter accepts input from MySQL's SHOW GLOBAL STATUS command, in the form generated by the following script:</p>

<code>
while sleep 10; do
   date '+TS %s.%N' | tee -a status &gt;&gt; processlist
   mysql -e 'SHOW GLOBAL STATUS' &gt;&gt; status &amp;
   mysql -e 'SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST\G' &gt;&gt; processlist &amp;
done
</code>

<p>That script might create large files.  For most purposes, the following is adequate:</p>

<code>
mysql -e 'SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST\G' &gt; processlist
while sleep 10; do
  date '+TS %s.%N' &gt;&gt; status
  mysql -e 'SHOW GLOBAL STATUS' \
    | grep -e Questions -e Uptime -e Threads_running &gt;&gt; status
done
</code>

<p>The converter looks at Questions, Uptime, and Threads_running.  For 
each sample, it computes the queries per second as the throughput, and 
the average of the Threads_running from this sample and the previous 
sample.  It has the following characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<li>It automatically subtracts 1 from Threads_running, because the 
thread doing SHOW GLOBAL STATUS will increase that variable by 1, but is
 not really part of the workload being measured.</li>
<li>It applies -n to the Threads_running count as well.  If you have 
replication slaves attached to this server, they will artificially raise
 Threads_running, but are again not really part of the server's workload
 in most cases.</li>
<li>It respects -i, so you can aggregate over time windows longer than 
10 seconds.  If you do so, then Threads_running is computed as the 
average of all the samples of Threads_running seen over the interval, 
not just the beginning and end.</li>
<li>It respects -m and will ignore any samples whose Threads_running is larger than this.</li>
</ul>

</dd>

<dt>tcpdump</dt>
<dd>
<p>This converter accepts input from tcpdump, in the form generated by 'tcpdump -tttt -nnq'.</p>

<p>The converter watches for TCP conversations beginning with a message 
from some host/port combination to the port that you specify with -P.  
It remembers the timestamp of this message, and when the server sends a 
message back, it counts the time elapsed.  As it processes input, it 
keeps track of the total time the system is busy, and the number of 
requests outstanding (unanswered) at each point, and computes a weighted
 average of the concurrency from that.  It ignores TCP messages that 
carry no data, such as 'ack'.</p>

<p>It currently does not respect other command-line options such as -i, 
-m, and -n.  These need to be factored out of the globalstatus converter
 so they can be applied to all converter functions.  It is also a 
relatively new converter and might have bugs.</p>

<p>The default port number of -P is 3306.</p>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>


<p>Here is a sample dataset that we can model:</p>

<code>
# threads  read only   read write
1  955.16   562.62
2  1878.91  1258.05
4  3548.68  2503.93
8  6531.08  4446.48
16 9897.24  6391.45
</code>

<p>This data is a partial sample from <a href="http://www.percona.com/docs/wiki/benchmark:cisco:scale:start">this benchmark</a>.  The first line is commented out, and the <em>usl</em> tool will ignore it.</p>

<p>The tool will print out information on its findings after looking at the input and computing or finding C(1), for example:</p>

<code>
Parameters to the model:
min(N)  1
max(N)  16
max(C)  9897.24
C(1)    955.16
N=1 ??? 1
</code>

<p>The above means that N=1 was present in the data, and the value for 
N=1 was found to be 955.16.  Check the input data again to verify this.</p>

<p>The first graph to look at is the computed efficiency.  Ensure that 
no points are shown with greater than unity efficiency, as this is 
unphysical.  Click on the image for a larger version.</p>

</p>

<code>
a       0.00131418
b       0.0164629
R^2     0.998991
</code>

<p>Next you should look at the graphs to see how closely the polynomial 
fits the deviation from linearity, and ensure that it looks like the 
source data is actually parabolic and the line fits the points well.  
Inspect the residuals (the difference between the fitted curve and the 
transformed source data points).  Ensure that the residuals appear 
randomly distributed, and that there is no apparent pattern that might 
indicate the source data should really not be accepted as an input.  The
 residuals-squared is also plotted, and can help you identify outliers 
if you need to scrub the input data.  And the residuals-squared is 
plotted against the Universal Scalability Law as well.</p>

</p>

<p>You can view the model-vs-actual graph to see the end result.  The 
red and green lines are the estimated errors from the least-squares 
regression.</p>
